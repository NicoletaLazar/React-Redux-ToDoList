# React ToDoList

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project let us do things like tracking a list of items, adding/removing items, handling user input, and updating the UI when that data changes.

## Technologies Used

### `React`

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### `React-Redux`

- Adding Redux to a React Project by adding the @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux packages
- Create a Redux store using RTK's configureStore API, and pass in at least one reducer function
- Import the Redux store into your application's entry point file (such as src/index.js)
- Wrap root React component with the <Provider> component from React-Redux

### `Chakra UI`

A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives us the building blocks we need to build our React applications.
